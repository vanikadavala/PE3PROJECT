TITLE: Build a Serverless Real-time Data Processing App

INTRODUCTION :
In this project, weâ€™ll learn how to build a serverless app to process real-time data streams. 
we'll create software using Amazon to instantly process and display this data. we'll process 
real-time streams using AWS Lambda, store records in a NoSQL database using Amazon 
DynamoDB, aggregate data using Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics, archive raw data to 
Amazon S3 using Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose, and perform ad-hoc queries on the raw 
data using Amazon Athena.
